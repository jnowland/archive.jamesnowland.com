				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The buying process has changed over the last few years with the rise of the net and social media. Since working in advertising I&#8217;m now extremely analytical about my own buying process.</p>
<p>Recently I bought a new road bike and kept a list of the steps I took.</p>
<h3>This is the way I buy things over and around $250:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Initial <a title="Road Bikes on eBay" href="http://www.ebay.com.au/sch/i.html?_trksid=p5197.m570.l1313&amp;_nkw=road+bikes&amp;_sacat=0&amp;_from=R40" target="_blank">research on eBay</a> to see what is in my price range, discover a benchmark price to see how much local shops have marked up the product and weigh up the new vs second hand possibility.</li>
<li>Use this research I worked out my goals and what I wanted out of the product I&#8217;m researching.</li>
<li>Visit the sites of <a title="Felt" href="http://www.feltbicycles.com/Australia.aspx" target="_blank">the</a> <a title="Giant" href="http://www.giant-bicycles.com/en-au/" target="_blank">brands</a> <a title="Specialized" href="http://www.specialized.com/au/en-au/home" target="_blank">of</a> in the category I&#8217;m looking at.</li>
<li>Googling the product name plus the word &#8220;<a title="Reid Cycles Forum Review" href="http://forums.whirlpool.net.au/archive/1633997" target="_blank">forums</a>&#8221; and &#8220;<a title="Google Search for Reid Cycles" href="http://www.google.com.au/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=reid+bike+reviews&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;redir_esc=&amp;ei=HLJBUazYCMiKmwWR74DQAg" target="_blank">reviews</a>&#8221; looking for owner feedback and more important how the company dealt with any negative feedback.</li>
<li>Additional research for video reviews of the <a title="Youtube product review" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wExJKPkfxI" target="_blank">product on YouTube</a>.</li>
<li>Using <a title="Advanced Search" href="https://twitter.com/search?q=reid%20cycles&amp;src=typd" target="_blank">twitter advanced search</a> to track down other owners and <a href="https://twitter.com/jnowland/status/271516001483497472" target="_blank">asking for non bias reviews</a>.</li>
<li>Present the above research to my wife…</li>
<li>Going in-store, armed to the teeth with information.</li>
</ol>
<p>In this instance I wanted a new entry level road bike that could enable me to ride greater distances than I could on a mountain bike and keep up with my mates on their road bikes.</p>
<p>I ended up settling on a <a title="2013 Reid Osprey" href=" http://www.reidcycles.com.au/bicycles/road-bikes/2013-reid-osprey-road-bike.html" target="_blank">2013 Reid Osprey Road Bike</a> from the information I could find there was little difference between it and other entry level bikes from other brands that were at-least another $400 extra.</p>
<h3>Controlling and influencing these channels.</h3>
<p>Reid Cycles did a good job with their digital marketing and have control and influence over all the research channels I went down:</p>
<p>They were on eBay (with a decent rating).<br />
The used <a href="http://www.google.com.au/ads/innovations/remarketing.html">display advertising re-marketing</a> after I went to their site so their ads were everywhere.<br />
They used Adsense on other bike searches.<br />
They had a suspicious amount of single post forum users leaving positive reviews.<em> This was actually a turn off.<br />
</em>They were on social media.</p>
<h3>Gorilla Digital Marketing done right:</h3>
<p>For a company that appears to do majority of it&#8217;s business online they seem to recognise the importance of getting their product in-front of consumers (through eBay and SEO) that don&#8217;t know their brand and tell their story through a rather controlled way over a series of third party sites. This is a classic example of a smaller company using Gorilla Marketing tactics with far less overheads of the larger companies.</p>
<p>While in the case of Reid Cycles I&#8217;m unsure if  a third party company is behind all of their digital marketing but it is good to see people executing on their digital strategy and providing a decent product to go with it.</p>
<p>So to hopefully help others in my shoes…</p>
<h3><strong>My 2013 Reid Osprey Review:</strong></h3>
<p>I&#8217;ve done around 450km on the bike so far and haven&#8217;t had any issues other than a flat. Which you will get as the tires are pretty average and thin. The $100 free kit they offer with every bike is pure marketing spin with the actual kit being low quality. I wasn&#8217;t able to even get my tires over 80 PSI with the pump without the plastic bending and looking like I would snap it. To be honest I wasn&#8217;t overly surprised by this and it certainly didn&#8217;t influence my decision but the kit still didn&#8217;t meet my low expectations I had for it.</p>
<p>The bike does it&#8217;s job and has allowed me to achieve the things I wanted from it so far, I can do 2hr plus rides on it and keep up with my mates on far more expansive bikes. The gears have ran finIt should be noted this is from the perceptive of a first time rider who would be no where near as fussy as others.</p>
<p>Now phase two of this plan is to ride this new road bike enough to convince my wife I need (and will used) a bike with carbon everything and mental telepathy gears.</p>

Converting it into a rather practical way to learn.</p><p>The post <a href="http://jamesnowland.com/notes/iphones-accessibility-features/">Learning by using the iPhone&#8217;s accessibility features</a> appeared first on <a href="http://jamesnowland.com/notes">James Nowland</a>.</p>]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By digging deeper into accessibility features on my iPhone, I was able to make a good dent in the outstanding articles in my &#8220;read later&#8221; list. This turned the iPhone from a device I don&#8217;t overly enjoy reading from to a rather efficient way to learn on the go.</p>
<p>Recently I have become a father which has made it more difficult to juggle out of office hours learning such as reading industry blogs and listening to podcasts. In the web design field this type of learning is almost compulsory if you want to try and stay on top of the ever changing best practices for web design and online marketing.</p>
<h4>The scenario</h4>
<p>Upon becoming a father I knew that a large amount of lifestyle changes were heading my way so I preemptively culled my twitter feed that is majority industry related and switched from reading lots of blog articles at home to listening to podcasts on my walk in to work. As I do enjoy listening to industry related podcasts to aid my learning but they often don&#8217;t provide the in-depth analyses you usually get from well written articles. Ideally I would of loved to be able to read the articles on my way into work, trying to do so would more than likely have me walking into someone or something. Instead I started diving into a few iPhone settings in the &#8220;accessibility tab&#8221; hoping to find a some type of way to read the webpage I&#8217;m on. After a bit of playing around, I now have enabled &#8220;Speak selection&#8221;.</p>
<p>This allows me to select an entire blog post and &#8220;play&#8221; it which solves my problem, allowing me to listen to the blog post while walking in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://jamesnowland.com/notes/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/iphone-text-to-speak.jpg"><div class="swpf-img"><img class="size-medium wp-image-119 alignnone" title="iphone-text-to-speak" src="http://jamesnowland.com/notes/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/iphone-text-to-speak-169x300.jpg" alt="" width="169" height="300" /></div></a></p>
<p>While I previously have used JAWS and other accessibility tools to test and develop an understanding of how accessibility impacts my web development work. Using accessibility on my iPhone really opened my eyes up to how accessible the device really is. So much so time poor people without any disabilities can benefit from the feature.</p>
<h3>How to turn Speak Selection on</h3>
<p><a href="http://jamesnowland.com/notes/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/iphone-accessibility-speak.jpg"><div class="swpf-img"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-118" title="iphone-accessibility-speak" src="http://jamesnowland.com/notes/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/iphone-accessibility-speak-1024x454.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="322" /></div></a></p>
<p>General &gt; Accessibility &gt; Speak Selection</p>
<h4>Further benefits to &#8220;Speak selection&#8221;</h4>
<p>An additional benefit to using Speak Selection is that it assists in proofing my writing, as I often overlook the linking words in sentences when I review my own work. I&#8217;m finding having my writing read aloud really helps highlight the areas for improvement.</p>
<p>Give it a go and let us know what you think. With 700,000 apps now on iOS there are likely some other apps that also solve this problem another way so if you have any suggestions it would be great to hear from you.</p>

This is great for file size until you need to make a wordpress theme that requires CSS comments to work.</p>
<p>Instead of using a CSS import with the @import in your CSS file you can save the extra http request with loud comments in sass.</p>
<pre>/* This comment gets removed from sass compressed. */</pre>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I recall the first time I set up sublime, it was a tad confusing on how to make it awesome. So the second time of installing it I noted the steps to make it awesome.</p>
<h4>Setting up sublime text editor</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go here: <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/" target="_blank">http://www.sublimetext.com/</a> Download and install it.</li>
<li>Get <a href="http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control/installation" target="_blank">Sublime Package manager to download</a> the good stuff. Copy the code below.<br />
<code><br />
import urllib2,os; pf='Package Control.sublime-package'; ipp=sublime.installed_packages_path(); os.makedirs(ipp) if not os.path.exists(ipp) else None; urllib2.install_opener(urllib2.build_opener(urllib2.ProxyHandler())); open(os.path.join(ipp,pf),'wb').write(urllib2.urlopen('http://sublime.wbond.net/'+pf.replace(' ','%20')).read()); print 'Please restart Sublime Text to finish installation'<br />
</code></p>
</li>
<li>Launch the console: View &gt; Console. Paste in the code.</li>
<li>Restart Sublime</li>
<li>Open package control: Sublime Text &gt; Package Control</li>
<li>Type &#8220;install&#8221; packages. Grab the packages you like.</li>
</ol>
<p>Being a front end coder I&#8217;d suggest you get the following packages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Zen Coding</li>
<li>jQuery</li>
<li>HTML 5</li>
<li> SCSS</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My initial mobile navigation solution left a lot to be desired.</p>
<p>So it was back to the drawing board. I started to analyse how other solutions worked, and was looking everywhere for inspiration and a suitable solution.  About two days later I caught a tweet to <a title="Responsive Navigation Patterns" href="http://bradfrostweb.com/blog/web/responsive-nav-patterns/" target="_blank">this article by Brad Frost</a>.</p>
<p>One of the things I liked in the article is Brad listed the <em>pros</em> and <em>cons</em> for each solution.</p>
<p>After reviewing Brad&#8217;s list my two favourite solution were:</p>
<h4>&#8216;The Toggle&#8217; approach</h4>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The toggle is similar to the footer anchor approach, but instead of jumping down to an anchor at the bottom of the page, the menu slides open right in the header. It’s a good-looking approach and is relatively easy to implement&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><em>followed by:</em></p>
<h4>&#8216;the footer anchor&#8217;</h4>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;This clever solution keeps the navigation list at the footer of the site, while the header contains a simple anchor link pointing to the footer navigation. This approach clears up a lot of room for the core content while still providing quick access to the navigation.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I have a preference for  navigation menus, which while user friendly do not impede on the limited screen space of small devices, such as smartphones and hand held gaming devices.</p>
<p>One of the cons with &#8216;the toggle&#8217; is it&#8217;s dependency on javascript.  By contrast, one of the pros of &#8220;the footer anchor&#8221; is that it is not dependent on javascript.  However, to their credit both solutions maximise mobile real-estate.</p>
<h3>The Obvious solution</h3>
<p>I decided to use both approaches to maximise screen real estate.  For uses with javascript  they would receive &#8220;The Toggle&#8221; navigation and for users with NO javascript they would be receive the fall back &#8220;The footer anchor&#8221; navigation.</p>
<h4>Coding the Hybrid Solution</h4>
<p><div class="swpf-img"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-35" title="Hybrid Responsive Navigation" alt="" src="http://jamesnowland.com/notes/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/responsiveNavigation.gif" width="300" height="431" /></div></p>
<p>Use of the <em>&lt;noscript&gt;</em> tag was used in the footer and also the header shown above in orange. Running next to the toggle but with only one solution ever visible at any given time.</p>
<p><div class="swpf-img"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-36" title="Responsive States" alt="" src="http://jamesnowland.com/notes/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/responsiveNavigation2.gif" width="904" height="620" /></div></p>
<p>On the smallest style sheet the &lt;noscript&gt; footer and link are only visible when javascript is off. The javascript toggle is hidden by default and turned on via the javascript by adding a class to the html.</p>
<p><div class="swpf-img"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-37" title="Hybrid Non Mobile" alt="" src="http://jamesnowland.com/notes/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/responsiveNavigation3.gif" width="904" height="620" /></div></p>
<p>On the tablet css document the no script tags are hidden and the menu up top is visible by default.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My original logo was 5 years old. That is roughly 25.347222 x Longer than Kim Kardashian&#8217;s last marriage. Just as it had its attention, scored a few jobs and help earn an income &#8211; so did my logo. After all that time, I also wasn&#8217;t in love with my logo. It was time to move on.</p>
<h4>Facing some facts</h4>
<p>From what I&#8217;ve seen it is rare that a designer won&#8217;t grow out of their own visual identity. I personally believe this is because of either:</p>
<ol>
<li>We get tired of seeing things after a period of time</li>
<li>We improve over time and get embarrassed by our old work/short comings.</li>
</ol>
<p>For similar reasons &#8211; I don&#8217;t have a tattoo.</p>
<p>My original logo was designed whilst completing my diploma in graphic design and served as a means to get my foot in the door with a professional agency. While my original logo design and branding received much positive feedback, over the recent years the ambiguousness of the design has been the subject of some odd comments. In hindsight, the logo itself lacked focus and direction, and the interchangeable use of the the upside &#8220;?&#8221; and&#8221;J&#8221; created much confusion as to its meaning.</p>
<p><div class="swpf-img"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-53" title="Webdesigner Logo Evolution" src="http://jamesnowland.com/notes/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/webdesignerLogoEvolution.gif" alt="" width="598" height="403" /></div></p>
<h4>The new logo</h4>
<p>For my next branding my aim was to encapsulate what I strive to communicate everyday in my designs.</p>
<h4>Clarity and simplicity.</h4>
<p>With logos I&#8217;m a huge fan of minimalism &#8211; when creating a logo it is important to remember that the logo is just one element of your branding. Logos should be utilised to entice your target audiences, be highly recognisable, and draw association with your product. They are NOT there to tell the full story of your branding.</p>
<h4>Enter the motif approach</h4>
<p><div class="swpf-img"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-60" title="Wedding Motif Logo" src="http://jamesnowland.com/notes/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/weddingMotif.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="192" /></div></p>
<p><em>Above: Motif branding used for my own wedding — J&amp;A.</em></p>
<p>In dabbling with various motif designs for my own wedding, I began appreciating their use and diversity.  Motifs while often simple in design work well both on small or large scales and can provide important continuity in your branding.</p>
<h4>Making the logo</h4>
<p>As much as I would normally be able to show pages of logo sketches I cant because truth be told&#8230;</p>
<p><em>&lt;overshare&gt;</em></p>
<p>My initial logo redesign was done in my shower, drawing on the frosted glass one morning.  Later that same week it was finalised  in illustrator. It had only taken me 3 years of study, 5 years working professionally and two hours on a winter night for me to finally complete the re-design of my logo.</p>
<p><em>&lt;/overshare&gt;</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Would love to hear your thoughts/feedback below.</p>

<p>I commenced designing the current version of this site in mid 2010, starting with the re-design of <a title="The Logo Rebrand (2012)" href="http://jamesnowland.com/notes/logo-redesign/">my personal branding</a>.  It was around this time the expression &#8220;Responsive Web Design&#8221; (or <a title="RWD" href="http://twitter.com/#!/search/%23rwd">#RWD</a> on twitter) was becoming popular with bloggers and on twitter.  Unsure whether Responsive Web Design was  just another web trend or something I should take note of I invested in a <a title="Responsive Web Design" href="http://www.abookapart.com/products/responsive-web-design">great book written by Ethan Marcotte</a>.  This book bridged the gap in my understanding, and provided a comprehensive overview of what RWD was and its application with modern devices.  Most importantly the book left me with the understanding that RWD wasn&#8217;t just an alternate approach to mobile designs but a solution to a new problem started by Steve Jobs with the launch of &#8220;post desktop devices.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was a short time later that I discovered the mobile framework &#8220;<a title="Responsive Framework" href="http://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/projects/320andup/">320 and up</a>&#8221; which utilised a &#8220;Mobile First&#8221; approach.  That is where you start with a mobile design and build on the layers to form a desktop version for broadband users.</p>
<p>It was safe to say that with all these new developments and understanding of RWD and mobile frameworks my approach to web design had dramatically shifted.</p>
<h3>Goals</h3>
<ol>
<li>Refresh my site with new branding</li>
<li>Change the focus of my site from portfolio based to content based.</li>
<li>Apply my new understanding and learn more about responsive web design and designing for mobile.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Process</h3>
<h4>Step 1 &#8211; Wire frames</h4>
<p>After a few pen and paper sketches I jumped into Adobe Illustrator and made two art boards — mobile (320px wide) and desktop (1024px wide).</p>
<p><div class="swpf-img"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-56" title="Responsive Illustrator Artboards" src="http://jamesnowland.com/notes/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/responsiveArtboards.jpg" alt="" width="831" height="561" /></div></p>
<p><em>Note: While some of the design was done in illustrator, a lot of it was done inside the browser.</em></p>
<h4>Step 2 &#8211; Design</h4>
<p>After a few wireframes I was ready to jump in and give the site it&#8217;s look. I&#8217;ve had enough experience to know designing for yourself is painful but fun. There tends to be a horrible mixture of a perfectionist without constraints of time and money. A problem we never encounter on a client job.</p>
<p><strong>Rule of self-branding:</strong></p>
<p><div class="swpf-img"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-58" title="Self Branding Rule" src="http://jamesnowland.com/notes/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/selfBrandingRule.gif" alt="" width="571" height="180" /></div></p>
<p>I was right &#8211; The design was a long drawn out process with lots of experiments with layout and colour combinations. The project was drawn out longer with my iMac having some colour issues were what I saw looked fine but on other screens looked terrible. Which resulted in myself using the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/au/app/mypantone/id329515634?mt=8" target="_blank">Pantone iPhone app</a>.</p>
<h4>Step 3 &#8211; Coding</h4>
<p>In conjunction with wanting to refresh my own site, I also wanted to learn everything I could about RWD and avail myself of as much experience I could. Whilst I enjoy experimenting with new technologies, I prefer to self experiment rather than do it at the expense or under the pressure of client demands and expectations..</p>
<p>I used 320 and up for my framework. I read and re-read the commented code in html5boiler plate to ensure I am building according to &#8220;best practises&#8221;.</p>
<p><strong>The final outcome of my website was built using these technologies:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Html5</li>
<li>CSS3</li>
<li>JQuery</li>
<li>Php</li>
<li>WordPress</li>
</ol>
<p>One of the more unique features about the site is the <a title="Responsive navigation with noscript fallback" href="http://jamesnowland.com/notes/responsive-navigation-with-noscript-fallback/" target="_blank">menu system on the mobile version</a>. The menu uses a jQuery slideout to <strong>maximise screen area</strong> with a &lt;no script&gt; anchor in the footer as a fallback for users without javascript.</p>
<h4>Just launch already</h4>
<p>After enough delays I decided to set this site free. There are a few items I look forward to adding later when the time is right.</p>
<p>Enjoy.</p>
